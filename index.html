            " Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed soem structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particlular. was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial ever could have. In fact, I've often referred to it during my interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a fullstack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend"

            <h3>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. getting guidance was from them and learning from their experience was easy.</h3>
            <p>
            The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which i find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people
